<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="justify">
Heart disease prevention has become more important than ever. In order to ensure that more people may live healthy lives, effective data-driven methods for predicting cardiac problems can enhance the overall research and preventive process. Machine learning is useful in this situation. The heart illnesses are predicted with the use of machine learning, and the forecasts are rather accurate.

In order to determine whether a patient has heart disease, I've employed a range of Machine Learning algorithms that were developed in Python. This classification issue predicts whether or not cardiac disease is present by using a binary variable as the goal variable and a range of characteristics as the input features.

* Building a **Flask App** hosted on **Heroku**.
* **Sklearn** for pre-processing and Model Building
* Pandas, Numpy for csv reading, Data Processing, Data Cleaning, Visualization etc.
* Machine Learning algorithms used: Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

## Steps

* Installing Python, PyCharm to Computer.
* Creating Flask app by importing `Flask` module.
* Download the source dataset from [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).
* For Classification algorithm decided to predict the features `Classes` from the dataset which is Binary classification `(0 = Healthy Heart, 1 = Defective Heart)`.
* Prediction model LogisticRegression which is 80%+ correlated to Classes Feature.
